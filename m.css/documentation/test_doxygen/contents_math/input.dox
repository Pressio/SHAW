/** @mainpage

Here's a block formula:

@f[
    \hat q = [\boldsymbol 0, 1] + \epsilon [\frac{\boldsymbol v}{2}, 0]
@f]

And @f$ \hat q @f$ is how quaternion is denoted.

@f[
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
@f]

@f$c^2@f$ should be part of a new paragraph, not stuck out of it. The following
formula has a custom environment:

\f{eqnarray*}{
    g &=& \frac{Gm_2}{r^2} \\
      &=& 9.82066032\,\mbox{m/s}^2
\f}

/** @page error Error

This will blow up when rendered and should print a warning to output:
