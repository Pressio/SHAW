# Scope
This repository contains code for simulating (elastic) seismic shear waves in an axisymmetric domain.
The implementation uses Kokkos and Kokkos-kernels to enable performance portability,
and we provide capabilities to run both the full order model (FOM)
as well as the Galerkin reduced order model (ROM).
