   This step-by-step demos shows how to run a simulation involving multiple forcings simultaneously.

   This is done using the rank-2 formulation.

   Here we assume you already followed the `step-by-step guide <{filename}/getstarted/build_kokkos_host_serial.rst>`_
   to build the code and used ``MYWORKDIR`` as the working directory for that procedure,
   so that ``${MYWORKDIR}/build`` contains all the executables.
